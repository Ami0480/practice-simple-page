        Oats are used for human consumption as oatmeal, including as steel cut
        oats or rolled oats. Global production is dominated by Canada and
        Russia; global trade is a small part of production, most of the grain
        being consumed within the producing countries. Oats are a nutrient-rich
        food associated with lower blood cholesterol and reduced risk of human
        heart disease when consumed regularly. One of the most common uses of
        oats is as livestock feed; the crop can also be grown as groundcover and
        ploughed in as a green manure.
